# Final Fantasy IX CSR (CutScene Remover) patches for PSX discs (USA v1.2.1 / JP not numbered)
Theses patches are for USA and Japanese NTSC disc images for the intended purpose of speedrunning (although can also be used for casual playthroughs)

Greatest Hits USA discs boot up with "Published by Square Enix U.S.A. Inc."
<br>Black Label USA discs boot up with "Published by Square Electronic Arts L.L.C."
<br>If you get a warning message when applying the PPF, you have probably used the wrong PPF for your disc image

I would recommend keeping backup copies of your original disc images
<br>

Instructions
1. Download and extract PPF's
2. Apply PPF's to disc images (e.g. .bin file) using PPF-O-Matic
