# Final Fantasy IX CSR (CutScene Remover) patches for PSX NTSC discs
Theses patches are for NTSC disc images for the intended purpose of speedrunning

Patches with "r1" after the disc number are for the Greatest Hits version (game begins with "Square Enix U.S.A. Inc.")
<br>Patches without "r1" after the disc number are for the black label version (game begins with "Square Electronic Arts L.L.C.")
<br>If you get a warning message, you are probably using the wrong PPF for your disc image

I would recommend keeping backup copies of your original disc images
<br>

Instructions
1. Download and extract PPF's
2. Apply PPF's to disc images (e.g. .bin file) using PPF-O-Matic
